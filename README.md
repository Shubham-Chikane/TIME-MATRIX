Timetable Management System tailored to streamline and organize scheduling for educational institutions. Leveraging SQLite as the backend database and Python's Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI), the system offers a seamless solution for managing complex scheduling needs. This project highlights my expertise in database management, user interface design, and problem-solving in real-world applications.

Technologies Used:

Python: Utilized Python for core application logic, including algorithms for schedule generation and conflict resolution.
Tkinter: Employed Tkinter to create a responsive and user-centric graphical interface, facilitating ease of use and navigation.
SQLite: Integrated SQLite for robust and efficient storage of timetable data, providing a lightweight and effective database solution.

Key Features:

1.User-Friendly Interface: Developed an intuitive GUI with Python Tkinter, allowing users to easily create,view, and modify schedules through a visually appealing and interactive interface.
  
2.Database Integration: Utilized SQLite for reliable data storage and retrieval, ensuring data integrity and quick access to timetable information.

3.Access Control: Designed user authentication features to secure access and manage permissions,ensuring that only authorized personnel can modify sensitive timetable information.
